# Homework 1 Progress Report

### Day 1 Monday: 
I made the initial settings, structured the folders and somehow figured out how to synchronize it all (before that, I worked with github at most twice, so I don't understand a lot, but I kind of learned).

### Day 2 Tuesday:
I disassembled and solved the first challenge from the first task. I drew the visual on paper.  I think, I'll redraw it and upload it later. (when I learn and figure out this drawing program). As I read the task, I came up with two solutions to this problem at once, implemented the one that seemed more concise.

### Day 3 Wednesday:
Today I solved the other two problems from the first task. I solved them on the litcode 2 years ago, so in fact it didn't take much time.

### Day 4 Thursday:
Today I started and completed the second task. I hope I did everything right because I had doubts about whether I understood the task well enough.
